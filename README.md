<h1>Portfolio</h1>
<h2>Welcome to my portfolio.</h2> 
<p>
This page is alway underconstruction. I will be adding new content and features as I imrpove my knowledge in Web Development
</p>

<p>
  To this point you can find sections about my trajectory in Web Development and a preview of my background in Fashion and the social organization I am part of.</p> 
<p>
  For this project I am using HTML and CSS.
  I used for my layouts grid, flexbox, CSS animations and more techniques for centering images and sections.
</p>  

<p>As I continue to build more features and sections, I implement new things I learned or maybe make a nicer layout.</p>
